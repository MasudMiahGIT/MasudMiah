Hi there, my name is Masud Miah:wave:

- üéì Graduated with 1st class honours in Computer Science from University of London -  Queen Mary

- üìó Im learning the fundementals of being a software engineer consultant with [Xander Talents](https://www.xandertalent.com/)

l have developed a good foundation from my studies which includes critical thinking, analysing, and solving technical problems in a logical manner. Other assets include being an active listener always keen to be learning something new. I have had the aim of studying an aspect connected to computer science from a young age. I undertook computer science degree as it contains aspects for all my interests such as programming, networking, Artificial Intelligence, software development, electronics engineering, game development and database systems etc. I have the passion to improve my understanding in the computing/IT field because this is the digital age meaning that there are industries that provide new and improved technology constantly; l want to be part of this.

I‚Äôve completed various projects during my time in university such as Implemented a third person speed-running, action-adventure game that allows the player to race through levels set with multiple obstacles and puzzles. This was created by using the tools MS Visual Studio and Unity with the programming language C#. In addition, created an application used for elections campaigns to enable canvassers/tellers to differentiate voters from non-voters (using real-data). This was created by using the tools Eclipse and MySQL Workbench with the programming languages Java and SQL. Finally, developed an online newspaper web app using Django framework with HTML, CSS JavaScript, and Python
